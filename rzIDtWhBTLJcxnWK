* :rzIDtWhBTLJcxnWK: "Glicksohn et al. (1999, 1992) have more recently studied the relationship between synesthesia and eideticism, suggesting that both groups have hte common characteristic of cognitive dedifferentiation (what Baron-Cohen et al. [1993] called "a breakdown of modularity"). For example, synesthesia entails the dedifferentiation of sense modalities, whereas eidetic imagery entails the dedifferentiation of imagery and perception."
