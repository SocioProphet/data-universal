@title "The debate over neurogenic versus varcular causation of migraine reaches back more than 100 years. Abundant data show that both the changes in blood flow and the spreading depression cross boundaries -- both vascular and anatomical ones. This is logically inconsistent with the standard explanation, even though vascular changes are well documented in, and are currently accepted as, the cause of metabolic depression."
