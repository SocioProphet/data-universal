* :PEBzQiE: "These intersensory effects thus occur at asynchronies that are much larger than normally reported JNDs when directly asking for temporal order. Possibly, then, despite the fact that observers do notice small delays among the senses, the brain may still ignore these if it is of help to do so for other purposes, such as understanding speech (Soto-Faraco & Alsius, 2007, 2009)."
