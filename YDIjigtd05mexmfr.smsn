@title "Conversational speech is made up of a series of phonemic clauses strung together. [...] It has been observed that a speaker's body movements do not occur randomly but instead accentuate phonemic clauses. Dittman and Llewellyn (1969) affixed movement transducers to the heads, hands, and feet of college students and recorded their movements during a brief interview. They segmented their subjects' speech into phonemic clauses and found significantly more body movements at the start of phonemic clauses than anywhere else."
