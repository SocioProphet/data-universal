@title "The astonishing finding in this literature, however, is not that our body is synchronized with our own verbal utterances but that our body tends also to coordinate with the verbal utterances of anyone we happen to be listening to at the time. In one study examining head movements in listeners (Hadar, Steiner, & Rose, 1985), approximately one fourth of all head movements were found to occur synchronously with the speaker's speech."
