One specific problem is how we determine that a stimulus we are looking at now reflects the exact same item as one encountered before, an issue known as identity, numerical identity, or object identity (e.g. Hirsch, 1982; Leslie, Xu, Tremoulet, and Scholl, 1998; Meltzoff and Moore, 1998; Spelke, et al., 1995; Strawson, 1959; Xu and Carey, 1996)."
