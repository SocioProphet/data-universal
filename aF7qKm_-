* :F7qKm_-: "A high level of semantic mediation implies a broad range and richness of the ultimate perceptual domain: If the associations are mediated through semantically abstract shared meaning, then the precipitating stimulus should engender a group of percepts that share the same meaning, and the range of synesthetic associations should be as broad as nonsynesthetic controls. On the other hand, a direct, low-level one-to-one link suggests an extremely limited range, quite specific as to the particular stimulus-percept combination. If the neuronal-specificity linkage theory is correct, there should be virtually no variability in the stimulus-percept associations of a synesthete, unlike normals, who are already documented to mediate via shared connotative meaning. Presumably, a middle possibility exists that stresses a small range of associations through a fairly low-level, relatively semantically impoverished mediating structure."
