@title "The goal in setting synchrony in motion is to establish specific objective criteria by which events can be deemed nonindependent or patterned. A difficulty arises, however, in that the criteria become more difficult to meet as the fixed time frame (i.e. unit of measurement) becomes shorter. In other words, what may be synchronized to the second may not be synchronized to the millisecond. The temporal criteria used so far have been determined by the practical constraints of the recording instruments rather than by any theoretically derived definition of synchrony. At present it is unclear as to what the proper time criterion for synchrony should be."
