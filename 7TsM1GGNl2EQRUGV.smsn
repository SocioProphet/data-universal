@title "Semantic priming is a reliable implicit measure of semantic associations (Neely, 1991), whereas affective priming is an equally reliable measure of affective associations (see Klauer & Musch, 2003). The term priming refers to an increase in speed of response when targets are preceded by a semantically related as opposed to a semantically unrelated prime (see Neely, 1991)."
