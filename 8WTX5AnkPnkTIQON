* :8WTX5AnkPnkTIQON: "Behavior matching does not require that the behaviors be matched in time. In fact, research on mimicry often includes a lag, such that mimicry is adopted several seconds after the original behavior. If the delay is too short, the participant is more likely to detect the mimicry (Bailenson, Beall, Loomis, Blascovich, & Turk, 2004), and overt detection can have negative effects on affiliation (Bailenson, Yee, Patel, & Beall, 2007)."
