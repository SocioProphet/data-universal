* :PPZkAEZ: "This experiment aimed to establish whether it was possible to obtain "reverse Stroop" interference in the auditory modality. A paradigm identical to that of Experiment 1 was used, except that subjects were required to respond to the stimulus word spoken and not to the speaker gender. Reverse Stroop interference would occur if speaker gender exerted an influence upon the time taken to make a decision about which word was spoken."
