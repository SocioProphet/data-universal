* :b4bfEtWpUBEQJEKr: "For example, individuals typically identify the letter string DOCTOR (target) as a word (rather than a non-word) faster if they have just seen the related prime, NURSE, than if they have just seen an unrelated prime, such as TABLE. In the case of affective priming, targets are responded to faster when preceded by a similarly valenced prime than when preceded by a prime of a different valence (Klauer & Musch, 2003). For instance, the positive word SUNSHINE tends to be evaluated faster when preceded by the positive prime PUPPY than when preceded by the negative prime SNAKE."
