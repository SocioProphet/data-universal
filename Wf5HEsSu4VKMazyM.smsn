@title "Hintzman, Carre, Eskridge, Owens, Shaff, and Sparks (1972), Keele (1972), and Klein (1964) have all suggested that the interference occurs because of response competition during output. Klein (1964) had his subjects name the color in which several kinds of stimulus were printed: color words, words associated with color words (e.g., SKY, BLOOD) to varying degrees, neutral words, and nonwords. He found that the degree of semantic relationship of the printed words to color words directly influenced the amount of delay. He suggested that. this semantic influence could occur only subsequent to color-name retrieval, and might be caused by response competition at output."
