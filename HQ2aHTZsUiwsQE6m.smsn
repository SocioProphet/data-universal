@title "The sensory cortex is the storehouse of past impressions. They may rise into consciousness as images, but more often, as in the case of special impressions, remain outside central consciousness. Here they form organised models of ourselves which may be called schemata. Such schemata modify the impressions produced by incoming sensory impulses in such a way that the final sensations of position or of locality rise into consciousness charged with a relation to something that has gone before."
