@title "Synesthesia is spatially extended. This is a clarification from the first edition, in which I said synesthesia is projected. By 'projected' I meant that the percept is assumed to exist 'out there,' and not in the imagination. For example, if visualized, the synesthesias are projected on a 'screen' in front of the subject's face; if felt, they are within range of the immediate grasp. Projected synesthesias are experienced close to the body within reach of the limb axis, never farther away. The same is true of the kinesthetic sense that often accompanies synesthetic percepts: the perceived movement is close to the body."
