* :noKYGBY: "Visually an object of a certain size, shape, or color will carry more weight when placed higher up. Therefore, balance in the vertical direction cannot be obtained by placing equal objects at different height. The higher one must be lighter. An experimental demonstration with regard to size is mentioned by Langfeld: 'If one is asked to bisect a perpendicular line without measuring it, one almost invariably places the mark too high. If a line is actually bisected, it is with difficulty that one can convince oneself that the upper half is not longer than the lower half.' This means that iw one wants the two haives to look alike, one must make the upper half shorter."
