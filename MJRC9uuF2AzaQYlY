@title "Investigations of the internal semantics of the perceptual system aim at identifying the data formats, and thus the symbolic objects, on which the computational procedures of the perceptual systems are based. The form or logical structure of these symbolic objects and the structure of their interrelations define the core ‘perceptual ontology’ of the perceptual system and the type of computational principles that can be applied to these objects."
