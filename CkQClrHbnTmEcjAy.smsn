@title "[...] recently a new version of this questionnaire, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) has been devised, which incorporates what may be a particularly relevant new scale, psychoticism (P). Subjects who score highly on the P scale might be expected to show a larger Stroop effect because nonparanoid schizophrenics (high P scorers) appear to demonstrate a widening of selective attention that precludes them from inhibiting irrelevant stimuli (Dykes & McGhie, 1969; Payne, 1961; Shakow, 1963; Silverman, 1964; Weckowicz, 1957)."
