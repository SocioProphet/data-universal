@title "These results were obtained by flashing a uniform white disk (subtending 2 degrees at 5 degrees eccentricity) for a variable number of times (50 milliseconds apart) on a black background. Flashes were accompanied by a variable number of beeps, each spaced 57 milliseconds apart. Observers were asked to judge how many visual flashes were presented on each trial. The trials were randomized and each stimulus combination was run five times on eight naive observers."
