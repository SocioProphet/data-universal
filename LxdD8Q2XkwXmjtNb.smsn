@title "In a subsequent study, Hesse and Spies (1996) induced a negative or neutral mood state before participants completed a lexical decision priming task with a long SOA (500 ms). This longer SOA is thought to facilitate controlled processing of primes and targets, whereas a shorter SOA (<300 ms) is thought to facilitate automatic processing of primes and targets."
