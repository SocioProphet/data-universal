@title "This paper details a visual-concept-ontology driven knowledge acquisition methodology. We propose to use a visual concept ontology to guide experts in the visual description of the objects of their domain (e.g., pollen grain). The proposed knowledge acquisition process results in a knowledge base enabling semantic image interpretation."
