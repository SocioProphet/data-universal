@title "The temporal order of brief simple stimuli, such as a flash and a beep, that have a rather sharp rise time of energy is much easier to perceive than are time-varying stimuli with shallower slopes (van der Burg, Cass, Olivers, Theeuwes, & Alais, 2009). This has important consequences, because the rise time of a sound is easily confounded with the distance of the sound (distant sounds have shallow rise times; Blauert, 1997), and rise time may also explain why determining temporal order for audioâ€“visual speech can be notoriously difficult"\u2013visual speech can be notoriously difficult"
