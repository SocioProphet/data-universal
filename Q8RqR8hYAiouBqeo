* :Q8RqR8hYAiouBqeo: "In terms of CNS processes, semantic mediation would stress that synesthesia flows through the highest levels of neocortical processing, whereas neural linkage would stress direct linkages between various sensory channels, at quite low levels of brain integration. An intermediate position might stress a relative attenuation of cortical associative processing with a corresponding enhancement of 'lower' associations."
