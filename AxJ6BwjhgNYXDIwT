* :AxJ6BwjhgNYXDIwT: "The semantic differential is a generalizable technique of measurement. There are no standard concepts and no standard scales, the concepts and scales used in a particular study depending upon the purpose of the research. Single words serve most often as unitary semantic concepts (e.g. fraud), but nonverbal conceps such as Rorschach pictures, representational or abstract paintings, sculpture, and even sonar signals have been used (Osgood et al.  1957)."
