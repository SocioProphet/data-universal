@title "Condon and Sander (1974) observed in a hospital nursery infants only a few days old and found that infants synchronized their movements to human speech, even when it was tape recorded or in a language not native to the child's parents.  This ability to synchronize movement to auditory stimuli may be specific to human speech as the infants did not synchronize with nonspeech-related sounds (i.e. street noises or rhythmic tapping).  These findings were replicated in Japan by a group of researchers using a computerized grid system disigned to detect even the slightest movements (Kato et al., 1983)."
