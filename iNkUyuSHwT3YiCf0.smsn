@title "Although cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis and depend more on this pathway for ATP generation, inhibition of glycolysis alone may not be sufficient to effectively kill the malignant cells. It has been suggested that ATP depletion should reach certain thresholds in order to trigger cell death by apoptosis or necrosis processes, with a depletion of 25â€“70% ATP leading to apoptosis, and an over 85% ATP depletion causing necrosis (Lieberthal et al., 1998). Since all cancer cells contain mitochondria, some degree of ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation is still possible when glycolysis is inhibited. This may compromise the efficiency of glycolytic inhibitors to deplete cellular ATP. One way to achieve a high level of ATP depletion and improve therapeutic activity is to combine multiple ATP-depleting agents with different mechanisms of action (Martin et al., 2001). Indeed, early studies showed that the combination of N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (MMPR), and 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) is an effective ATP-depleting regimen that increases the anticancer activity of radiation, adriamycin, or taxol (Koutcher et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1994, 1996). Combination of glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose with adriamycin or paclitaxel also resulted in a significant increase of in vivo therapeutic activity in animal tumor models bearing osteosarcoma or non-small-cell lung cancer xenografts (Maschek et al., 2004)."\u201370% ATP leading to apoptosis, and an over 85% ATP depletion causing necrosis (Lieberthal et al., 1998).
