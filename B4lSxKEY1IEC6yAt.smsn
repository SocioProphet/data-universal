@title "The experimental stimulus words were "man" and "girl," spoken by a male or a female speaker, and subjects were required to judge speaker gender. Congruent and incongruent word/ combinations were generated as follows: The word "man" in the male voice and the word "girl" in the female voice were the so-called congruent. stimuli; the word "girl" in the male voice and the word "man" in the female voice represented the incongruent stimuli. "Girl" rather than "woman" was used because it was monosyllabic."
