* :nIGXwwjr38AwuINg: "A question which has been neglected in the literature consists of separating genuine perceptual contributions to the phenomena from voluntary post-perceptual adjustments. Using a new paradigm based on psychophysical staircases, we have shown that the visual bias of auditory location occurs even when the subject is not aware of the auditory-visual discrepancy, hence cannot reduce to voluntary corrections. Other experiments have demonstrated that ventriloquism cannot be explained by deliberate shifts of spatial attention. It is concluded that ventriloquism reflects a phenomenon of automatic crossmodal pairing, that is, formation of a cross-modal perceptual unit which takes place at a pre-conscious processing stage and thus must be clearly distinguished from conscious perceptual fusion."
