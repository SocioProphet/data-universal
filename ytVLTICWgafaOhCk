* :ytVLTICWgafaOhCk: "No mention was made of amodal stimuli, such as words or numbers, or of symbolic synaesthetic experiences, such as Gendlin’s ‘felt sense’ (a somatic sensation associated with a psychological issue) (Hunt, 1995). Consequently, these classes of experience may have been underreported, although several respondents from the advanced teachers group did give striking examples."
