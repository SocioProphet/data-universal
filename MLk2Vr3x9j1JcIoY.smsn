@title "Attitude names a complex psychological state or process which it is very hard to describe in more elementary psychological terms. It is, however, as I have [207] often indicated, very largely a matter of feeling, or affect. We say that it is characterised by doubt, hesitation, surprise, astonishment, confidence, dislike, repulsion and so on."
