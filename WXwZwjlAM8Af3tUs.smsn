@title "A third suggested instance of induced synaesthesia is associative conditioning. For example, Ellson (1941a,b) produced what he termed ‘hallucinations’ by repeatedly pairing colours in close temporal association with specific tones, and associative conditioning has often been suggested as a causal mechanism accounting for synaesthesia. However, recent fMRI studies of coloured hearing synaesthetes found that words activated parts of the visual system, specifically areas V4 or V8 of the fusiform gyrus. By contrast, no such activation occurred in nonsynaesthetes after associative conditioning (Gray et al., 2002; Nunn et al., 2002), thereby calling the relationship between synaesthesia and associative conditioning into question."
