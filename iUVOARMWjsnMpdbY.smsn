@title "We consider constraints ξ of the form φ(u, w) → ∃v ψ (u, v) where φ and ψ are conjunctions of atoms, which may include equations. Such constraints are known as embedded dependencies and are sufficiently expressive to specify all usual integrity constraints, such as keys, foreign keys, inclusion, join, multivalued dependencies, etc. We call φ the premise and ψ the conclusion."\u03BE of the form \u03C6(u, w) \u2192 \u2203v \u03C8 (u, v) where \u03C6 and \u03C8 are conjunctions of atoms, which may include equations.
