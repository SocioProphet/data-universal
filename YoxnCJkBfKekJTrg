The first process is auditory imagery; specifically, anticipating one's own sounds and the sounds produced by other performers. The second process, prioritized integrative attention, involves dividing attention between one's own actions (high priority) and those of others (lower priority) while monitoring the overall, integrated ensemble sound. The third process relates to adaptive timing, i.e., adjusting the timing of one's movements in order to maintain synchrony in the face of tempo changes and other, often unpredictable, events."
