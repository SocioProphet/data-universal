* :R9PmhuDUXkLOZ9hh: "Auditory Stroop interference did still occur when responses were labeled with words. semantically related to gender that were not identical to, or phYSIcally similar to, any of the stimulus words. The magnitude of the effect was smaller than in the data from Experiment 1 (26 msec compared with 64 msec); however, the pseudo-Stroop effect also remained evidence and was not attenuated (35 msec compared with 25 msec in Experiment 1), suggesting that stimulus-related, rather than response-related, processesare responsible for its existence."
