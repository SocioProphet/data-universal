* :jrUF3NATjMxolqx6: "8. When the irrelevant word on trial n -1 is the name of the target ink color on trial n, interference with color naming will be enhanced temporarily; when the ink color on trial n â€” 1 matches the word on trial n, there will be some facilitation of color naming on trial n. If the word on trial n - 1 is repeated on trial n, then the word is already suppressed and will cause less interference in naming a different ink color on trial n."
