* :mKDwvGfndpVZm2P9: "Semantic memory is often described as our organized general world knowledge and has been metaphorically compared to a dictionary, encyclopedia, or thesaurus (Katz & Fodor, 1963; Lyons, 1968; McKoon & Ratcliff, 1979; Smith, 1978). As a dictionary or lexicon, our semantic memory contains information concerning a concept’s identity, spelling, and pronunciation. As an encyclopedia, semantic memory contains dense information regarding a concept’s meaning. Finally, as a thesaurus, semantic memory contains information about which other words have similar meanings."
