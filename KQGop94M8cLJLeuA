Thus, one can select certain behavioral features that are theorized to influence interaction and then control or manipulate only those features. For example, in studies of nonverbal behaviors believed to be crucial to the fabric ofsocial interaction, such as mutual gaze or interpersonal distance, one can systematically alter only the gaze or the interpersonal distance aspects ofthe virtual representations of participants, thereby allowing strong tests oftheorized functions ofthis important nonverbal aspect ofsocial interaction. An experimenter could vary the simulated eye gaze of a male interactant from gaze aversion to staring or leering, without his knowledge, and determine the influence of this manipulation on the interaction between the male and a female interactant, both ofwhom inhabit the same virtual environment."
