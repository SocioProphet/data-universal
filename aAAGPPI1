* :AAGPPI1: "The main disadvantage of synchrony ratings is that until now, the method has been used only on silent recordings. It is not known whether the validity of synchrony judgements can generalize to recordings that contain speech. Because some synchrony researchers have strongly emphasezed speech, it is important for us to know what effect the presence of speech has on synchrony perceptions. Diven the possibility of a synchrony channel compensation process mentioned earlier, we should be able to measure both the verbal and nonverbal channels of communication for synchrony."
