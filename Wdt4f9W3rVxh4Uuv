* :Wdt4f9W3rVxh4Uuv: "Shared featural information (e.g., shape, size, intensity) can also be combined to improve object discrimination. On the other hand, asynchronous, spatially disparate, and/or semantically incongruent inputs from different modalities can be significantly less effective in eliciting responses than the unimodal stimuli alone (Stein et al., 1989; Sekuler et al., 1997)."
