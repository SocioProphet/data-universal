@title "[...] numerous researchers, beginning with Gallup (1970), have taken self-recognition in a mirror as an indicator of self-awareness in infants and nonhuman primates. Mirror self-recognition must be based on perceiving the synchrony of one's own movements with those of the face in the mirror (because young children or chimpanzees cannot know what they look like physically). For these reasons, witnessing an entity behaving in accordance with one's motor commands defines that entity as part of the self."
