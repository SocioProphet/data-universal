@title "The latency of peak III of the brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) increased by an average of 0.5 msec as a result of exposure of the eighth nerve, and if that increase is assumed to affect the entire length of the auditory nerve (2.6 cm) evenly, then the corrected estimate of conduction velocity would be 22.0 m/sec."
