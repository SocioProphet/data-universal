@title "This study provides experimental support for the ancient claim that meditation can induce synaesthesia. As such, it provides one more example of a general trend in meditation research. Specifically, it provides experimental evidence for a meditation-induced capacity that contemporary Western researchers had previously dismissed as impossible. Examples of other such ‘impossible’ meditation-induced capacities include voluntary control of the autonomic nervous system, dramatically heightened perceptual sensitivity, and the existence of lucidity during both dreaming and nondreaming sleep (Brown et al., 1984; Murphy & Donovan, 1997; Walsh & Vaughan, 1993). This suggests that it may be worthwhile to investigate classic claims that meditation can enhance a variety of other sensory, motor and psychological siddhis or capacities (Murphy, 1992)."\u2018impossible\u2019 meditation-induced capacities include voluntary control of the autonomic nervous system, dramatically heightened perceptual sensitivity, and the existence of lucidity during both dreaming and nondreaming sleep (Brown et al., 1984; Murphy & Donovan, 1997; Walsh & Vaughan, 1993).
