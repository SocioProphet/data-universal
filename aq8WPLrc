* :q8WPLrc: "Synesthetes never see pictorial dreamlike scenes or otherwise have elaborate percepts.  They perceive blobs, lines, spirals, lattices, and other simple configurations.  Starting the the 1920s Heinrich Kl√ºver identified four types of consistent hallucinogenic images: (1) gratings and honeycombs, (2) cobwebs, (3) tunnels and cones, and (4) spirals.  Variations in color, brightness, symmetry, and replication provided further gradation of the subjective experience.  The point is that given a wide variety of stimulation, the brain seems to respond in finite ways."
