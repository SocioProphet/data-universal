* :Yi1fhsx: "In laboratory studies of multisensory perception, semantic congruency effects are typically assessed by measuring the consequences of presenting matching or mismatching object pictures and environmental sounds (such as a woofing sound paired with a static picture of a dog or cat; Hein et al., 2007; Molholm, Ritter, Javitt, & Foxe, 2004) or of visually presenting letters with matching or mismatching speech sounds (e.g., van Atteveldt, Formisano, Goebel, & Blomert, 2004)."
