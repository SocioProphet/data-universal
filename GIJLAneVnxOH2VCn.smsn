@title "I have already made plain my distaste for what is typically an American approach to medical technology -- namely, a fishing expedition that produces computer-generated images supposedly showing the brain anatomy underlying the cognitive task in question. But such images are already a highly abstracted construct of countless data points, with little understanding behind what they actually represent. They are neither a representation of reality nor a model of actual histology. Yet we continue to stand back, look at the pictures, and marvel. (Lest I be widely misunderstood let me state that there is a relationship but no identity.) I am no Luddite, but I prefer technology to either confirm or disconfirm a hypothesis -- not to be a tool for castin about in search of something interesting."
