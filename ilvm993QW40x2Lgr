* :ilvm993QW40x2Lgr: "Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) that employ 3-D computer-generated avatars to represent human interactants (as opposed to direct video feeds) may provide an ideal balance between the limited information offered via audio communication and the problems that seem inherent to videoconferences. In most current CVE implementations, interactants have the opportunity to utilize two perceptual channels: audition and vision. However, unlike a videoconference, a CVE operating system can be designed to render a carefully chosen subset of interactantsâ€™ nonverbal behaviors, filter or amplify that subset of behaviors, or even to render nonverbal behaviors that interactants may have not performed."
