@title "If the percentage of “simultaneous” responses is plotted as a function of the SOA, one usually obtains a bell-shaped Gaussian curve (see Figure 1). The peak of this curve is taken as the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS), in that it is assumed that, at this particular SOA, the information from the different modalities is perceived as being maximally simultaneous. The second measure that can be derived from this curve is its standard deviation (SD), which is reflected in the width of the curve. This width, or some measure derived from it, can, as a first approximation, be taken as the window of temporal integration, because it conceivably represents the range of SOAs at which the brain treats the two information streams as belonging to the same event."
