@title "The main explanation for semantic, as well as affective, priming has been spreading activation, a mechanism based on network models of memory (Klauer & Musch, 2003; Neely, 1991). Activation has been thought to spread from prime to target when the two share an associative link in semantic memory, thereby influencing decisions about targets. Such activation of associated concepts is assumed to occur automatically and without intention for both semantic priming (Neely, 1991) and affective priming (Bargh, 1997)."
