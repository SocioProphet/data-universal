@title "Using an automated objective video-analysis algorithm (Motion Energy Analysis, MEA), we calculated nonverbal synchrony in (N = 104) videotaped psychotherapy sessions from 70 Caucasian patients (37 female, 33 male, mean age = 36.5 years, SD = 10.2) treated at an outpatient psychotherapy clinic. The sample was randomly drawn from an archive (N = 301) of routinely videotaped psychotherapies. Patients and their therapists assessed session impact with self-report post-session questionnaires."
