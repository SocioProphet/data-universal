* :yparTCC: "In perceiving the sound produced by the movement of a visible object, the brain coordinates the auditory and visual input so that no delay is noticed even though the sound arrives later (for distant source objects, such as aircraft or firework displays, this is less effective). Here we show that coordination occurs because the brain uses information about distance that is supplied by the visual system to calibrate simultaneity. Our findings indicate that auditory and visual inputs are coordinated not because the brain has a wide temporal window for auditory integration, as was previously thought, but because the brain actively changes the temporal location of the window depending on the distance of the visible sound source"
