@title "These diverse body parts - eyes, mouth, trunk, head, arms, fingers, etc. - tend to change and sustain direction of movement together. If one body part moves or changes direction of movement, it does so concomitantly and in concert with the other body parts moving at the same time [...] What is being described is an ongoing flow of 'moments-of-sustaining together' of body parts."
