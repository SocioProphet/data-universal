* :haZXenC: "Roseboom and Arnold (2011) adapted observers to male actor on the left of the center of a screen whose lip movements lagged the sound track, whereas a female actor was shown on the right of the screen whose lip movements preceded the soundtrack. Results showed that audiovisual synchrony estimates for each actor were shifted toward the preceding audiovisual timing relationship for that actor. Temporal recalibrations thus occurred in positive and negative directions concurrently. This refutes the idea of a generalized timing mechanism but, rather, supports the idea that perceivers can form multiple concurrent estimates of appropriate timing for audiovisual synchrony"
