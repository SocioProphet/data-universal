* :oi0bP1Y9xffqvoZS: "Temporal lags below 20 msec are usually unnoticed, probably because of hard-wired limitations on the resolution power of the individual senses. Above this limit, delays do become noticeable, in particular if stimuli (1) have fast transient rise times, (2) are spatially separated, (3) have predictable onsets, and (4) are presented rhythmically at rates ,4 Hz. It has been speculated that lags might become unnoticed because the brain is intelligent and compensates for predictable delaysâ€”in particular, delays caused by sound distance. This idea, however, is controversial and has not been demonstrated compellingly with natural stimuli (i.e., without headphones) and/or with good performance (e.g., low JNDs). Temporal lags among the senses may also go unnoticed, because there is mutual attraction among the senses. In part, it reflects a general tendency of the brain to reduce errors among the senses about information sources that normally yield converging data about the same event."
