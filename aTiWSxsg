* :TiWSxsg: "One might expect, as depicted in Figure 1, that the JND as measured in a TOJ task corresponds well with width of the Gaussian curve obtained in an SJ task (i.e., the window of temporal integration), because temporal order should be difficult to judge if stimuli are perceived as simultaneous. A large temporal window should thus correspond with high JND values. The match between these two measures, however, is, in general, quite poor."
