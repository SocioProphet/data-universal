* :9RJuEP7: "William Condon (Condon, 1970; Condon & Ogston, 1966, 1967) observed this physical tracking to one's own speech at a microlevel of analysis, at which many individual instances of body-to-speech synchronization can occur within a mere fraction of a second. More importantly, he observed an apparent breakdown in this process in certain abnormal samples. Children suffering from dyslexia and other learning disabilities, for example, show deficiencies in the ability to synchronize their movements with speech rhythms (Condon, 1982), as do schizophrenics (Condon & Ogston, 1966). It seems, then that normally we do invvoke our entire body when communicating with others and that the patterns we generate in our speech are found in the movements we concurrently produce."
