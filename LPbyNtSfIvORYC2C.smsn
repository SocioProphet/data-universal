@title "Even in subjects who have considerable linguistic sophistication, almost half the total variance in meaningful judgements is accounted for by only three stable factors: evaluation, potency, and activity. A pervasive evaluative factor in human judgment regularly appears first. Namely is it good or is it bad? Next the potency factor is concerned with power and things associated with it -- size, weight, toughness, and so forth. Third, the activity factor is concerned with quickness, excitement, warmth, agitation, and the like."
