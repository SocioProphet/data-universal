@title "Recent research by Gottfried and Dolan (2003) has shown that the presentation of visual stimuli (i.e., complex pictures) can influence olfactory information processing. Gottfried and Dolan (2003) reported that people detected the presence of an odor more rapidly and accurately when a semantically congruent picture was presented at the same time (e.g., the picture of a double-decker bus when smelling the odor of diesel)."
