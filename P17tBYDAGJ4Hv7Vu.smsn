@title "Technologically, sensors can emulate these human cognitive and associative mechanism by searching for similar events from the past, using the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud [1]. As opposed to the human memory,the “memory” of the LOD cloud is virtually unlimited and a sensor acting like a human would be potentially able to understand what is hidden behind raw data, better than humans could do. This view provides the dual approach to the human acting like a sensor as proposed by [5] and further investigated by [9]."
