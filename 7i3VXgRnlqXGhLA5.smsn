@title "To behaviorally demonstrate sensory integration, one must show that perception via one modality (e.g., vision) is substantially influenced by a concurrent signal via another modality (e.g., audition). If an object could be identified unimodally through either vision or audition, however, a presumed crossmodal integration could the result of a semantic interaction rather than a sensory integration. For a behavioral crossmodal-integration effect to provide evidence for sensory integration, the effect must occur even when object identification is possible through only one modality."
