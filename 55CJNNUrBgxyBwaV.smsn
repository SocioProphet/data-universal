@title "This research investigated the interaction dyad. That is the investigators did not specifically measure the degree of entrainment or coupling between individuals, but instead, measured the degree to which the interaction dyad as a unit displayed any periodicity in behavior over time. The implicit assumption was that if any dyadic rhythms were found, both individuals in the dyad must be contributing to it by coordinating their behavior."
