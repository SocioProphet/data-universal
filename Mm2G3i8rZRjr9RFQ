* :Mm2G3i8rZRjr9RFQ: "The underlying notion for both spatial and temporal ventriloquism is that the brain integrates, despite small deviances in space and time, signals from different modalities into a single multisensory event. Critically, when the deviance between the signals in space or time is too large, the signals likely originate from different events, in which case there is no reason to “bind” the information streams."
