@title "As a first approximation, one might assume that the size of the window of temporal integration corresponds to the JND measured in TOJ or SJ tasks. Interestingly, however, this is not always the case, because there are also other, more indirect measures of the window of temporal integration that do not correspond with JNDs as measured in TOJ or SJ tasks. As an example, Munhall, Gribble, Sacco, and Ward (1996) demonstrated that exact temporal coincidence between the auditory and visual parts of audioâ€“ visual speech stimuli is not a very strict constraint on the McGurk effect."\u2013 visual speech stimuli is not a very strict constraint on the McGurk effect."
