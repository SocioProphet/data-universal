* :VXYpnlj: "Some investigators are interested primarily in the smoothness of turn taking within conversations. For practical reasons, measiring dis-synchrony turns out to be easier than measuring synchrony. Examples of turn-taking dissynchrony include things like simultaneous speech, mutual silences, and interruptions. Turn taking is considered smoother and more synchronous to the extent that turn-taking breakdowns are less frequent and shorter in duration."
