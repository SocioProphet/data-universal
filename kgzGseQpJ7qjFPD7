@title "[...] recent work suggests that the tight perception-action linkages that promote mimicry may also be involved in synchrony. A recent EEG experiment on interpersonal finger tapping revealed an oscillatory component that seems to enhance mirror system activity during synchronous, but not asynchronous behavior (Tognoli, Lagarde, DeGuzman, & Kelso, 2007)."
