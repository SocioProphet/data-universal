* :zJbBBKusNPYFS9nh: "Synesthetic percepts are consistent and discrete.  The associations for an individual synesthete are consistent over his or her lifetime.  If a sound is blue, it will always be blue; the context of the stimulus does not influence it.  This has been affirmed repeatedly by testing individuals without warning up to 46 years apart with the same stimuli.  Synesthetes who experienced several modalities do not experience different sets of modalities in different situations.  Rather, the pattern remains the same."
