* :MgLVQ7ljp4a51mZc: "10. When the color (or picture) is to be named, maximal impact of a congruent or incongruent word will be observed when the two dimensions begin within 100 ms of each other. Facilitation may extend to longer SOAs than interference when the word comes first. Manipulating SOA has virtually no impact on word reading unless a very high proportion of congruent trials biases use of the color to initiate response production."
