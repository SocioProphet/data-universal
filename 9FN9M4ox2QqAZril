* :9FN9M4ox2QqAZril: "We demonstrated auditory-visual integration in the perception of face gender by pure tones that are processed in low-level auditory brain areas and that lack the spectral components that characterize human vocalization. When androgynous faces were presented together with pure tones in the male fundamental-speaking-frequency range, faces were more likely to be judged as male, whereas when faces were presented with pure tones in the female fundamental-speaking-frequency range, they were more likely to be judged as female."
