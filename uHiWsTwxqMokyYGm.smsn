@title "The effect was biggest when auditory vowels were synchronized with the original mouth movements (McGrath & Summerfield, 1985), but the effect survives, even if audition lagged vision by 180 msec (see also Soto-Faraco & Alsius, 2007, 2009; these studies show that participants can still perceive a McGurk effect when they can quite reliably perform TOJs at intervals above the JND). So, speech-sound identification can be influenced by lipread speech even if the two are perceived as being out of sync"
