@title "In this preparation the impedance is not purely resistive but comprises a capacitance of 35-45 nF in parallel with a resistance of 8-12 kSl. These values are similar to those for epithelia, such as frog or Necturus gallbladder, with similar tight-junctional morphology (11; unpublished observations). The microphonic potential was thus not directly proportional to the transduction current but was delayed by the capacitance of the epithelium. Knowledge of the epithelial time constant permits one to determine the extent of this delay and to correct for it."
