@title "On each trial, a 100-ms pure tone [500 Hz, 50 dB(A)] was presented from two loudspeaker cones (one positioned on either side of the screen) to cue the participant to inhale so that he/she would be sure to perceive the odor. Each odorant was presented for 4 s prior to the presentation of the color patches. All 10 colors were displayed on the screen until the participant responded. The relative spatial position of each of the color patches was randomly varied on a trial-by-trial basis to ensure that their position on the screen remained unpredictable. The participants were instructed to select the color that they felt most closely matched the odor presented on that trial by pointing to it using the computer mouse and clicking the left-mouse button to confirm their choice."
