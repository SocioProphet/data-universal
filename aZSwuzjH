* :ZSwuzjH: "In interactions largely devoid of rhythmic stimuli external to the dyad, the time giver is one (or both) of the interactants. In this case, the location of the zeitgeber in the dyad may have some implications for its social composition. For example, the stability of a zeitgeber within one individual throughout an interaction may be a physical manifestation or consequence of the dominance relationship between the interactants. Baron and Boudreau (1987) speculated that dominance can be defined as the discrepancy between the proportion of time that Person A serves as the time giver for an interaction relative to the time that Person B serves as time giver."
