@title "Recently, there have been substantial advances in the understanding of cone transduction with fish as the model [120, 121, 124, 176, 177]. On the other hand, despite the enormous success in studying rod phototransduction by a combination of mouse genetics and suction-electrode recording in recent years, the usage of mouse as a model system for studying cone phototransduction has until recently been limited to ERG studies. This is mainly due to the rarity of cones (âˆ¼3%) and the fragility of the COS. This hurdle was overcome recently by Pugh et al. [67, 178], who have developed a new configuration for recording from mouse cones."\u223C3%) and the fragility of the COS. This hurdle was overcome recently by Pugh et al.
