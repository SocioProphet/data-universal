* :9LjDFMQCzbVJ9bUf: "Refinement of awareness is one of the seven central goals and practices of the world’s meditative traditions, and is now supported by considerable experimental evidence (Murphy & Donovan, 1997; Walsh, 1999). Subjectively, meditators report ‘introspective sensitization’, heightened sensitivity to both inner and outer stimuli (Goldstein, 1983; Walsh, 1977; West, 1987). Objectively, meditation effects on perception include unique Rorschach test responses, enhanced field independence and empathy, and increased perceptual sensitivity and processing speed as measured tachistoscopically (Brown & Engler, 1986; Brown et al., 1984; Forte et al., 1985; 1987; Shapiro & Walsh, 1984; Shapiro et al., 1999). (For reviews see Alexander et al., 1992; Andresen, 2000; Murphy & Donovan, 1997; Shapiro et al., 2002; Shapiro & Walsh, 1984, 2003; Walsh, 2000; Walsh & Vaughan, 1993; West, 1987)."
