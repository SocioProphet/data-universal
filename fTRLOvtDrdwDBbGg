* :fTRLOvtDrdwDBbGg: "Performance on selective-attention and divided-attention tasks shows strong and consistent interactions when participants rapidly classify auditory stimuli whose linguistic and perceptual dimensions (the words low vs high, low and high pitch, low and high position in space) share common labels. Compared with baseline performance, response times were greater when one or two irrelevant dimensions varied (Garner interference) and when combinations of attributes were incongruent rather than congruent (congruence effects)."
