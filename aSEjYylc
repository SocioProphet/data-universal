* :SEjYylc: "36 words were chosen to represent the 6 values of the Allport-Vernon Study. Length and familiarity of words were equated in each category. Each word was shown to each of 25 college students at exposures starting at .01 second and increasing until recognition occurred. [...] A chisquare test indicates significant relationship between value orientation and recognition time. [...] It is proposed that value orientation produces selective sensitization, lowering thresholds for acceptable stimuli and raising thresholds for unacceptable stimuli. [...] Perceptual defense leads a person to avoid the meaning of low-value words, whereas value resonance keeps a person responding in terms of valued objects even before perception is certain."
