* :dA0Eer1ZNIG7D4tc: "In an attempt to organize the path between cause and effect we envision a need for a standard for haptic application software modeling. In order for the software to better enhance the tactile information sensation, flow and perception and also make interaction between humans and haptics more efficient and natural, we need a formal representation of the haptics domain. This article proposes the use of HASM, a haptic applications software modeling ontology to formally model the haptics domain in order to be used during the specifications and design phases of developing software applications for haptic interfaces."
