@title "On each trial, a picture was accompanied by a sound that was semantically congruent, semantically incongruent, or else neutral (i.e., white noise) with respect to the visual target. Semantic congruency was manipulated as a within-participants factor. In the congruent condition, the sound matched the picture. In the incongruent for fear of any unwanted semantically-related priming effects occurring, the paired sound and picture belonged to different semantic categories. In other words, a picture of an animal was always accompanied by the sound of a tool, or instrument, and so on."
