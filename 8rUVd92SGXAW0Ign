* :8rUVd92SGXAW0Ign: "Dittman and Llewellyn (1969) recorded the movement of speakers' hands, head, and feet and found that during speech, movements were more likely to occur early in phonemic clauses and in speech hesitations. That is, the movements were not distributed randomly throughout the course of a conversation but were much more likely to correspond to the rhythm of speech. It was as if the physical movements of the body were tracking the articulatory structure of the speech."
