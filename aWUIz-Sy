* :WUIz-Sy: "Many instances of interactional rhythms have already been discovered. Hayes and Cobb (1982) for example, recorded the conversational behavior of a couple who lived together in isolation for 30 days. They found that verbal activity was not randomly distributed throughout the day; rather, the level of conversation actively varied cyclically every 90 to 100 minutes, suggesting that the man and woman were entrained to the same verbal behavioral cycle. Even after this rhythm was interrupted by an unplanned set of natural events, the same stable rhythm reemerged."
