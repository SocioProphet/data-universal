@title "The results from Experiment I are quite clear. The single-colored letter condition produced a significantly smaller Stroop effect than did the all-colored-word condition. If words are always read automatically in such a way that they activate the semantic level, the single-letter condition should have produced as much of a Stroop effect as did the whole-word condition. The fact that it produced a smaller Stroop effect suggests that the automatic reading hypothesis which has prevailed over the last six decades is too strong."
